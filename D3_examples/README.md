Learning D3 for data visualization

1) grid.html is a modification of an example from TJ Decke (http://bl.ocks.org/tjdecke/5558084). It reads data.tsv and creates a gridded heatmap.
   - transposed grid
   - resized grid blocks
   - transitions (TBD)
   - add some jitter to data (TBD)
   - add dropdown menu to change color scheme (TBD)

2) map.html is a modification of Mike Bostock's chloropeth example (http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060606). It reads a tsv of unemployment by county and displays a heatmap.
   - updated to use colorbrewer 
   - added map projection
   - replaced hard-coded scaling with dynamic (almost works)
